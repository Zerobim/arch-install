#+TITLE: An example of arch linux installation

* Status
It works!!. Options are really limited, though. And it might fail if something
changes.

* Purpose
This repository contains a script that allows to install Arch linux on a new
machine, with all the configuration needed to have a running system.

Most if not all the information appearing here was taken from the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide][arch wiki
installation guide]], so this is just a reference for me and maybe educational
purposes.

There may be more or better things like this, but this might serve as reference
for somebody having problems with the installation, and I think its not a bad
exercise.

* How it works
The file ~arch-install.org~ contains a recopilation of the information in the
[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide][arch wiki installation guide]] and maybe other sources in ~org~ format. The code
snippets this file contains are tangled to generate the required scripts to
install the system.

- ~custom.sh~: Configuration / customization of the changeable values. You should
  define the environment you want with these.
- ~install.sh~: Launch script. Redirects ~stderr~ and ~stdout~ to be able to access
  the information in case of an error.
- ~run_in_{live,system}.sh~: Code to run in the live system or the installed
  system.

* Usage
- *!!! WARNING !!!* use this at your own risk. *YOU WILL LOSE DATA* if you run this
  without understanding what it does. I'm not liable for any damage caused by
  running any of this scripts.
- *NOTE* : Scripts may only be up to date in ~master~ branch.

  How to use it:

  1. Download this repository. The default arch image might require you to
     install ~git~.
  2. Check ~custom.sh~ and adapt the values there to your liking.
  3. Run ~./install.sh~. Output is stored in ~install.{out,err}~. ~stdout~ is also
     displayed.
  4. Check everything is correct and ~reboot~. The system should work.

* Next
For things that might be done in the future, search for ~TODO~.
